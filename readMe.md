# TAXY

### What is TAXY

TAXY is an app targeted at the self-employed or anyone who needs to submit a tax-return an aims to take advantage of the new Open Banking regulations. These essentially require that banks will provide a customer (or a 3rd Party authorised by the customer) with all their bank account details/transactions etc in JSON format. A user of the TAXY app can aggregate all their bank transaction data in one place and determine which transactions are relevant for their tax return and which are not. Once this is done, they can filter by tax year and will have a summary of what they will need to put on that tax years return. 


### How to use

Taxy is more of a proof of concept as I am not able to obtain sufficient authoristation to upload users bank account details even if I could get permission from them individual. Therefore, although a user can sign up they will not be able to import their own data.

In order to check out the functionality of the app, please make a request in your browser to https://taxytaxy.herokuapp.com/api/users/ and pick email address any of the users listed (these are all fictional) and login with the password, which is 'password' for all users.
